You can write a lifecycle method that gets called right before a component renders for the first time.

You can write a lifecycle method that gets called right after a component renders, every time except for the first time.

There are three categories of lifecycle methods: mounting, updating, and unmounting. This lesson is about the first category: mounting lifecycle methods.

A component "mounts" when it renders for the first time. This is when mounting lifecycle methods get called.

There are three mounting lifecycle methods:

componentWillMount
render
componentDidMount

When a component mounts, it automatically calls these three methods, in order.
